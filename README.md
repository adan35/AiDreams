### *(Capstone Project)* Emotion Detection from English Test (EmoD)

Our project is about detecting the emotion or tone of the English text. We have found that deep learning works best for this objective. We plan to use word embedding with LSTM. We have also found a couple of datasets that we plan to use. The output we hope to have is that our model should be able to predict emotions being portrayed in the text and we will that information using different emojis. The benefits of our model are many, we could for example classify the sentiment of the customerâ€™s review for a product or service. Next, we have discussed that responsibilities we have assigned to each member and what is our schedule that we plan to follow.

this is amazing project
